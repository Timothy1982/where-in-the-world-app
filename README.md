A little app that lists all countries. You can filter them by region or search by name.
As a little bonus you can switch the theme between a light and a dark theme.

This is my solution to the **Frontend Mentor** Challange. You can check out the challange [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
